### Email Autoresponders

An email autoresponder is an email or sequence of emails that are automatically distributed to your subscriber list after being triggered by a certain event, such as when consumers sign up for your email newsletter, abandon their shopping cart, download an e-book or purchase a product.

Email autoresponders help nurture your leads, turn them into customers and free up your time to focus on other important tasks for your business. Combined with email segmentation, email autoresponders are an extremely powerful tool.

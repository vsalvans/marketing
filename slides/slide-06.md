### Retargeting

Retargeting works by dropping cookies into your website visitors’ browsers. When they leave to visit other websites with retargeting ads enabled, your ad will be displayed, keeping your brand top of mind.

Website visitors who are retargeted with display ads are 70% more likely to convert on your website. And the great news is that retargeting is not just for websites. You can also retarget prospects who open your marketing emails.

Retargeting networks (including Facebook) also allow you to upload email lists to their servers, which is a worthwhile strategy for testing with old, dormant emails that have been sitting in your company’s CRM for years.

### Email Segmentation

As mentioned earlier, consumers do not mind being targeted by email as long as that email is relevant and specific to their needs. One way to make sure your message is relevant to your companyâ€™s prospects is through email segmentation.

Email segmentation involves dividing up your subscriber list into smaller segments based on specific criteria. It is generally used to personalize emails, making them more relevant to subscribers based on criteria such as geographic location, interests or behavior (such as purchase history), just to name a few.

According to the Direct Marketing Association, "segmented and targeted emails generate 58% of all revenue."
